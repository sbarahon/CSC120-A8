- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

My class represent a virtual robot dog named Retro! He can do most things that normal dogs can do, such as walking and catching things, but, he can also fly, shrink, and grow on command. The main program runs an interactive program where the user can type different things they want the robot dog to do and the programe executes until the user decides to stop.


- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I added methods that allowed me to include an animation before calling the method involved with the interface. I did this for an added throw method and an examine_animation method. I was using the java.Lang.Thread import but that didn't work for methods that didn't have any parameters or methods that weren't void. I kind of had limited choices as to which methods I could do animations for, but, I did them where I saw fit! I also added a throw method since I thought it would be cool to be able to throw something at a dog that they then would be able to catch/grab. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

As mentioned I had some trouble getting the animations to be able to work given the interface because I needed certain return types or parameter types that would have violated the contract/interface. Also, it was very hard to think of an undo method, but, I decided that since this is a made-up robot dog, he could simply just "undo" something. I also struggled to think of what to do for the other methods such as use or fly but I made stuff up that I thought fit the scenario!

Also, I really wanted to create an interactive program where the user can continously input things into the command line and the robot dog will execute. It took a little bit of time, but, I was able to make it work within a while loop! Some advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is if you want to make a certain type of program happen, but you're struggling a bit, don't give up! Look up resources online or ask for help from fellow peers/professor.
